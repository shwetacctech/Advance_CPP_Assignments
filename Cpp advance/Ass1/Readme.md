# Assignment 1: Classes & Strings
## Description
This assignment focuses on understanding and utilizing classes and strings in C++. It explores the concepts of classes for object-oriented programming and <br>
string manipulation using the string class.

String Manipulation with the string Class
Example Demonstrating Classes and Strings

## Classes in C++
**Classes**: Classes in C++ are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and methods within a single unit.
**Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes enable the implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as <br>
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
String Manipulation with the string Class
string Class: The string class in C++ provides a convenient way to manipulate strings.
String Operations: Various operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and finding characters or substrings can <br>
be performed using the string class methods.

##void Reader::successMsg(){
     std::cout<<"File Loaded successfully"<<std::endl;
}
## 
Created this success message function for the use inside a class function to be called automatically when the file loads into reader
It uses the class called reader and void function successMsg()
