****Assignment 8: Algorithms and Iterators Workshop****
**Description**
This assignment focuses on understanding and applying algorithms and iterators in C++. It explores the use of standard algorithms provided by 
the Standard Template Library (STL) and the usage of iterators for data manipulation and processing.

About Algorithms and Iterators
Algorithms: Algorithms in C++ are reusable functions used to perform specific tasks on collections of elements. They are provided by the STL 
and operate on data structures such as vectors, lists, etc.

**Iterators:** Iterators are objects used to traverse and manipulate elements within a container. They act as pointers pointing to elements in a
sequence and provide a way to access elements in a container.

**Usage and Characteristics**
Algorithms:
STL provides a rich set of algorithms like sort, find, transform, etc.
They perform operations on elements within containers and can take iterators as arguments.
Iterators:
Different types of iterators (e.g., begin, end, const_iterator) allow various operations on containers.
They support movement through containers and provide access to elements.
for (auto p : m)
    {
        std::cout <<"("<< p.x()<< "," << p.y()<<","<< p.z()<<")"<<std::endl;  
    }
